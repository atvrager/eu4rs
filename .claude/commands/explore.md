# Explore and Propose Tasks

Execute the exploration workflow defined in `.agent/workflows/explore.md`.

## Instructions

1. **Read workflow**: Follow all steps in `.agent/workflows/explore.md`
2. **Analyze recent history**: Check git log for patterns
3. **Search for TODOs**: Find actionable comments and placeholders
4. **Synthesize proposals**: Create a menu of 3-5 diverse task options
5. **Present to user**: Let them choose what sounds interesting

This is useful when the user wants to work on something but isn't sure what to tackle next.
